## API Integration Progress

### Authentication System Updates (March 2024)

#### User Structure Changes
- Updated user model to match API response structure
- Changed from single role to roles array
- Added firstName/lastName fields replacing name field
- Updated type definitions in `types/auth.ts` and `types/api.ts`

#### Authentication Flow
1. Login Response Structure:
```typescript
{
  "user": {
    "id": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "roles": ["string"]
  },
  "token": "string"
}
```

2. Key Components Modified:
- `AuthContext`: Updated to handle new user structure
- `Header`: Modified to display firstName/lastName
- `ProtectedRoute`: Updated role checking logic
- `RegisterForm`: Added firstName/lastName fields
- `Hero`: Updated role-based feature access

#### Implementation Details
1. Token Management
   - Using localStorage for token storage
   - JWT verification updated for new user structure
   - Automatic token removal on expiration

2. Role-Based Access Control
   - Changed from single role to array-based checking
   - Updated all role checks to use `Array.some()`
   - Protected routes now check against role arrays

3. Form Handling
   - Updated validation schemas
   - Added proper error handling for API responses
   - Improved UX with loading states

### CORS Configuration Update (March 2024)

#### Changes Made
- Added `withCredentials: true` to axios client configuration
- This enables proper handling of cross-origin requests with credentials
- Allows cookies and authentication headers to be sent in CORS requests

#### Technical Details
1. CORS Issue:
   - Browser blocking cross-origin requests due to missing CORS headers
   - API server at localhost:3000 not properly configured for requests from localhost:5173

2. Solution:
   - Enabled credentials in axios configuration
   - Ensures proper handling of authentication headers
   - Maintains session consistency across origins

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Ensure API server has corresponding CORS configuration
- [ ] Add error handling for CORS-related failures
- [ ] Monitor for any authentication-related issues

2. Component Updates:
   - Modified TopicTests component to use API data

### Subject Selection API Integration (December 2024)

#### Comprehensive Changes
- Removed all hardcoded subject data
- Fully dependent on `/api/subjects` endpoint
- Enhanced error and loading state handling
- Improved responsive grid layout
- Simplified navigation mechanism

#### Key Improvements
- Dynamic subject rendering
- Fallback states for:
  - Loading subjects
  - No subjects available
  - API fetch errors
- Consistent UI/UX across different subject counts

#### Implementation Details

- Utilizes `useEffect` for initial data fetch
- Handles various API response scenarios
- Provides clear user feedback during different states

#### Next Steps
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
- Optimize performance for large subject lists

### API Endpoint Correction (December 2024)

#### Issue Identified
- Incorrect API endpoint used: `/api/subjects` instead of `/subjects`
- Causing "Failed to Load Subjects" error

#### Fixes Applied
- Updated endpoint in multiple components
- Added console error logging
- Maintained existing error handling mechanism

#### Best Practices
- Verify API base URL configuration
- Use consistent endpoint naming
- Implement comprehensive error tracking

#### Next Steps
- Review all API endpoint usages
- Implement centralized API configuration
- Add more detailed error reporting
