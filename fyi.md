#### Authentication Flow
1. Login Response Structure:
```typescript
{
  "user": {
    "id": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "roles": ["string"]
  },
  "token": "string"
}
```

2. Key Components Modified:
- `AuthContext`: Updated to handle new user structure
- `Header`: Modified to display firstName/lastName
