## API Integration Progress

### Authentication System Updates (March 2024)

#### User Structure Changes
- Updated user model to match API response structure
- Changed from single role to roles array
- Added firstName/lastName fields replacing name field
- Updated type definitions in `types/auth.ts` and `types/api.ts`

#### Authentication Flow
1. Login Response Structure:
```typescript
{
  "user": {
    "id": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "roles": ["string"]
  },
  "token": "string"
}
```

2. Key Components Modified:
- `AuthContext`: Updated to handle new user structure
- `Header`: Modified to display firstName/lastName
- `ProtectedRoute`: Updated role checking logic
- `RegisterForm`: Added firstName/lastName fields
- `Hero`: Updated role-based feature access

#### Implementation Details
1. Token Management
   - Using localStorage for token storage
   - JWT verification updated for new user structure
   - Automatic token removal on expiration

2. Role-Based Access Control
   - Changed from single role to array-based checking
   - Updated all role checks to use `Array.some()`
   - Protected routes now check against role arrays

3. Form Handling
   - Updated validation schemas
   - Added proper error handling for API responses
   - Improved UX with loading states

### CORS Configuration Update (March 2024)

#### Changes Made
- Added `withCredentials: true` to axios client configuration
- This enables proper handling of cross-origin requests with credentials
- Allows cookies and authentication headers to be sent in CORS requests

#### Technical Details
1. CORS Issue:
   - Browser blocking cross-origin requests due to missing CORS headers
   - API server at localhost:3000 not properly configured for requests from localhost:5173

2. Solution:
   - Enabled credentials in axios configuration
   - Ensures proper handling of authentication headers
   - Maintains session consistency across origins

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Ensure API server has corresponding CORS configuration
- [ ] Add error handling for CORS-related failures
- [ ] Monitor for any authentication-related issues

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Add session timeout handling
