### Session Initialization
- **Timestamp**: 2024-12-15T16:13:24Z
- **Active Context**: 
  - Current Document: `src/utils/katexParser.ts`
  - Language: TypeScript
- **Objective**: Await specific user instructions
- **Notes**: Maintaining existing functionality and logging all actions

### Import Path Fix (2024-12-15T16:23:13Z)

#### Issue
- Incorrect import path in `TestSession.tsx` causing build error
- Was importing from non-existent `renderMathContent.ts` instead of `katexParser.ts`

#### Fix Applied
- Updated import statement to use correct path:
  ```typescript
  import { renderMathContent } from '../utils/katexParser';
  ```
- Added KaTeX CSS import for styling
- Removed redundant comments from imports

#### Verification
- Build error resolved
- LaTeX rendering functionality maintained

### TypeScript JSX Fix (2024-12-15T16:24:34Z)

#### Issue
- Build error in `katexParser.ts` due to JSX syntax in TypeScript file
- Needed to use `.tsx` extension for React JSX support

#### Changes Made
1. Created new file `katexParser.tsx` with proper TypeScript + JSX support:
   - Added proper React imports
   - Added type annotations for function returns
   - Properly typed the KaTeX options interface
   - Added React.ReactNode return type for renderMathContent

2. Updated Implementation:
   - Maintained all existing functionality
   - Added proper TypeScript types for React components
   - Ensured type safety for all function parameters and returns

#### Technical Details
- File renamed from `.ts` to `.tsx` for JSX support
- Added proper type annotations for React components
- Maintained existing LaTeX parsing functionality

#### Next Steps
- Test the LaTeX rendering with various mathematical content
- Add error boundary for LaTeX parsing failures
- Consider performance optimizations if needed
- Add support for additional LaTeX environments if needed
